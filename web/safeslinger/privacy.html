<p>The SafeSlinger Software was built to allow you to verify the identity of those you communicate with to achieve better security while messaging. We aim to store only the minimum information necessary to deliver your private messages to their intended destination as quickly as possible, and remove information as soon as possible from our servers.</p>
<p>Passphrase Data<br /> Your passphrase is never stored in any recoverable form, and as such, Carnegie Mellon as an operator of the SafeSlinger Software cannot help you recover your passphrase. Your only recovery option is to generate a new private key protected with a passphrase you choose.</p>
<p>Key Exchange Data<br /> When you exchange keys ("Sling Keys") using SafeSlinger, your public key exchange data is encrypted with temporary keys only you and those you exchange with have access to. Carnegie Mellon does not have access to any temporary keys. Encrypted key exchange data is removed from SafeSlinger's server application after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Message Data<br /> When you send messages using SafeSlinger, your message data is encrypted with a private key only you have access to. Carnegie Mellon does not have access to any private keys. Your private key is protected with a passphrase chosen by you, which you should not share with anyone. Encrypted message data is removed from SafeSlinger's server application after 24 hours.</p>
<p>Push Notification Data<br /> When you start using SafeSlinger, you register that your device may accept push notifications sent by other users via SafeSlinger's server application. Push notification content includes a random message id and may include encrypted message data to speed delivery if messages are small enough. These push notifications are used to prevent battery drain of your devices and are sent via push notification services operated by Apple and Google. Privacy policies for the respective services are found at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" title="Apple privacy policy">http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank" title="Google privacy policy">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Backup Data<br /> Your encrypted private key and encrypted identity data can be backed up if you choose. All backup data may be removed from cloud backup services by uninstalling the application from your device. SafeSlinger uses cloud backup services operated by Apple and Google. Privacy policies for the respective services are found at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" title="Apple privacy policy">http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank" title="Google privacy policy">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Crash Report Data<br /> If you encounter an error in the SafeSlinger Software and choose to send crash report data to its developers via email, text, or third-party such as Google Play and Crashlytics, Carnegie Mellon will retain that data for analysis. Crash report data can include: device id, model, versions, language, stack traces, and your comments to developers. SafeSlinger uses the crash reporting services of Crashlytics and Google Play to collect and store crash report data. Privacy policies for the respective services are found at <a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms" target="_blank" title="Crashlytics privacy policy">http://try.crashlytics.com/terms</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank" title="Google privacy policy">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>.</p>
